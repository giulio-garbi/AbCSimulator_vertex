# AbCSimulator

AbCSimulator is used to assess the performance of three different distributed infrastructures, proposed to coordinate the interaction for multiway communication model

To use the Simulator, you can go to the folder eu.quanticol.abcsimulator.tests. There are three main files, one for each infrastructure.
The code is self-explanatory and you can change the parameters and get results. 

In case you want to run a batch of test, you can try our batch simulation file, named SimulationBatch.Java. Once you supply the batch with
the requried parameters, it will perform the simulation on all the infrastructures and store the results in files.dat, the results folder. 

You can plot the results with external tools. If you are interested in running single simulation at a time and visualize the results, you can refer to other files.
Once the simulation is complete, the results will be plotted for you.
